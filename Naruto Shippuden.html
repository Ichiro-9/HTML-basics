      Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi
      Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks
      recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader
      of his village.
      <br><br>
      Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English dub was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011, airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. The English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Viz Media began streaming the anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012 on 99 episodes, and ended in March 2016, after 338 episodes. Besides the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.

Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters. The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.

    <p style="color: rgb(211, 204, 204);font-family: system-ui;">
      They had to have one final clash. This was to determine who's dream would be realized and finally settle things once and for all. The battle took place where their first one occurred, but now their power shattered the landscape. After their incredible powers had been spent, it devolved into a sloppy fight in the mud as both Sasuke and Naruto fought with their last bit of strength. They both ended up losing an arm, but Sasuke finally conceded to Naruto.

Sasuke attacks with fireballs, which Naruto dodges. Naruto creates clones, which attack with Rasengan. Using the Rinnegan, Sasuke pulls Naruto and his clones toward himself, and skewers them with black flames. The real Naruto blocks it with chakra arms, and attacks Sasuke from above with more arms.
